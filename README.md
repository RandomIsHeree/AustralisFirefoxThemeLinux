Australlis firefox theme for linux

There is no good australlis theme really its either unaccurate or only limited to windows so im going to make one and its only going to be tested on linux for a while (on Ubuntu 22.04 running Unity 7.5.1) 

i will try to make it look as accurate as I can 

Currently working on the homepage for it: im around 25% done it 

I will update the progress 

I have to rely on pictures for a while so im just going to make a VM of ubuntu 17.04 or something that would have old firefox so i can make it as accurate as possible
