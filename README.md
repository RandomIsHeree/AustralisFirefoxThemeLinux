# Australis Firefox Theme for Linux
Australis firefox theme for linux

There is no good australis theme really its either unaccurate or only limited to windows so im going to make one and its only going to be tested on linux for a while (on Ubuntu 22.04 running Unity 7.5.1) 

i will try to make it look as accurate as I can 
also im mostly just copying files from firefox 56 and just using them since firefox uses html and css so i can just copy the css from that firefox and done i copied the start page for ubuntu and home page but im trying to get the home page to work

Start page for ubuntu is finished:

Working on homepage now

I will update the progress 

I have to rely on pictures for a while so im just going to make a VM of ubuntu 17.04 or something that would have old firefox so i can make it as accurate as possible

# NO ESTIMATION DATE FOR FINISH JUST BE PATIENT
